These examples are taken from:
https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html

Some of them have been edited to be fuller (or simplier) JSON objects.

Several of them the examples have:
* properties reordered (so input order matches output order)
* empty properties (ie. `"formats":[]`) removed
* errors corrected
* some redundant ones removed
*
